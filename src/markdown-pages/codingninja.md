The final project of SAE Institution Web Design & Development studies. A team effort to put together all knowledge from studies.

The project was built from scratch with Laravel Framework as well as a lot of technologies used on Frond End like VueJS, Jquery,
Flexbox, Sass, Webpack etc. 

I mostly was in charge of Back End and put together all the assets designed and frond end features built by my fellow mates Petros Antonio
and Manos Vlachakis.
